# Log Line
A log-line and story prompt generator, written in Swift

A log line is a summary of a story. Writers use log lines to help them focus on a story's key points, or to pitch screenplays and novels to producers or publishers.
        
A log line needs to be concise - no more than one or two sentences - yet cover the narrative's central characters and conflicts. Most importantly, it needs to hook the reader in.

Log Line will generate short, compelling fictional scenarios designed to serve as a framework for narrative development. 

It will create: protagonists that have positive traits, negative characteristics and a goal; and antagonists with their own agenda. 

Excuse Mode creates tenable explanations that can be used to justify offensive, abberrant or inconsiderate behaviour.
